# Welcome to my Github Page!

I am driven by a deep passion for developing innovative AI-driven solutions that have a tangible impact on the industry. My robust background in traditional statistics, including a Ph.D. from North Carolina State University (NCSU), provides me with a solid foundation in the theory behind AI technologies. This foundation includes understanding fundamental concepts, such as quickly understanding the logic of applying frequency domain information to time series using transformer structures (Timesnet), and utilizing low-rank matrix approximations in the logic of LoRA. With a strong background in traditional statistics and modern AI technologies, I am eager to contribute significantly to the field and look forward to applying my knowledge in impactful ways.

While my career initially focused on traditional statistical analysis and model development, I recognized the immense potential of modern AI models. I am expanding my expertise into computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), and time series analysis. Advances in computing power have made brute-force approaches feasible, unleashing the potential of modern deep neural networks. I have quickly and deeply learned to leverage the powerful attention mechanisms of transformer architecture.

I have thoroughly explored and am mastering modern models such as GPT and BERT for NLP, ViT and YOLO series for CV, Informer, TimeNet and iTransformer for time series analysis. The Hugging Face API has been instrumental in implementing and experimenting with these models, accelerating my learning and application process. I can use the Hugging Face API proficiently, and my deep understanding of these models allows me to debug the source code and comprehend its internal structures easily.

This website chronicles my learning route, showcasing my steps to bridge the knowledge gap between traditional machine learning techniques and modern deep learning frameworks. It reflects my commitment to growth, ability to adapt, and passion for harnessing the full power of modern AI to develop innovative solutions. Along this journey, I have faced challenges such as mastering the vast number of transformer variants and developing proficiency in PyTorch. However, I have overcome these challenges with a dedicated learning approach and hands-on experimentation, strengthening my resilience and determination to succeed in AI.

Although I am making rapid progress, there remains much to learn. I am committed to forging ahead with determination and enthusiasm.
